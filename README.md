# Product Manager

####  Agile, User Research, Analytics | Substack Writer

## About
I have spent 10+ years in Tech, coming all the way up to the PM position. The road, obviously, had its hardships as I had quite a number of projects/companies I worked on over the years to keep the gears turning.
I am utterly frightened by complacency in whatever we talk about â€“ life, products, hobbies.
